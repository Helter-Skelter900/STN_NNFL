Spatial Transformer Network

This is a Tensorflow implementation of Spatial Transformer Networks by Max Jaderberg, Karen Simonyan, Andrew Zisserman and Koray Kavukcuoglu.

Components:

1)localization network: takes the feature map as input and outputs the parameters of the affine transformation that should be applied to that feature map.

2)grid generator: generates a grid of (x,y) coordinates using the parameters of the affine transformation that correspond to a set of points where the input feature map should be sampled to produce the transformed output feature map.

3)bilinear sampler: takes as input the input feature map and the grid generated by the grid generator and produces the output feature map using bilinear interpolation.
